* TODO pass by reference
* TODO mutable flag in type
* TODO templates

* TODO BUG ensure that int lit types are actually instantiated only once (BIG BUG right now)
* TODO C++ interop
* TODO not all ast nodes have correct ~source~ values, for example ~[]~, code needs to deal with it
* TODO display parsing errors as normal error messages
* TODO full coverage of all error messages
* TODO test operator precedence when many ~:~ and ~.~ are in use (currently buggy)
* TODO maybe return TypeFloat like in Nim for integer division?
* TODO virtual machine for compile time code execution
* TODO restrict operator precedence to common knowledge cases (+-*/) require explicit braces everywhere else.
* TODO test default value
* TODO compiler passes for some transformations (e.g. moving literals to constants)
* TODO persistent statistic logging about compiler bootstrapping time, lines of code, test time, test lines of code
* TODO performance tracking over time to know when the compiler gets slower and which commits cause compilation slowdowns.

** implement type checking on 'return'
** implement ~context~ type and parameter for ~TypeCheck~ functions
** provide proper error messages or error instead of panic
** negative literals
** error reporting instead of compiler crashing
** add error type to represent invalid / non-typeable ast
** test infrastructure compiler error reporting
** add field values to struct literals
** testing framework to test the compiler
** allow conversion between enum/int/string
** enum set type
** consistent Typ/Type member name
** distinguish between the type and the expression that defines it
** make high/low values of integer types somehow accessible.
** array access
** pointer
** have varargs for macros (only)
** define order to generate type definitions in
** generic arguments (important for builtin array access)
** add ability for type assertions
** static overloading
** automatic narrowing of literals when type is known from outside.
** documentation structure
** packages and import
** reserve double underscore and underscore pre- and postfix
** C interop (emit and function declarations)
